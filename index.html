      <h3 class="spacer"><span class="secondary ">Gregor Samsa</span></h3>
      <p class="spacer buffer-mini">Gregor Samsa is a stoic young man who highest priority is always the wellbeing of his family even when it comes at his own expense. Gregor used to be a traveling salesman a job that he hated, but he was absolutely committed to his work to support his family financially. After Gregor’s transformation he feels continuously guilty about his inability to help provide for his family. Ultimately after realizing he has become an unbearable burden; he dies relieving his family of himself. Gregor, the main victim of abuse within the story, is being exploited by his job and family. Gregor’s psychological descent shows the psychological cost of that abuse as it trained him to see his worth in terms of monetary value and nothing else. This causes him enormous shame because he can no longer provide for his family and so see himself as worthless burden to them. The tragedy of Gregor Samsa is not that just that he was abuse and abandoned his family, it that has he died Gregor believed his abuse was justified. </p>

      <h3 class="spacer"><span class="secondary ">Grete Samsa</span></h3>
      <p class="spacer buffer-mini">Grete Samsa is the youngest child of the Samsa family and a disappointment to her at the start of the story. Grete was unemployed and lacked any marketable skills for working. What she was good at was playing the violin, but her parents took no pride in this. Over the course of the story Grete goes from you girl to young woman getting a job and starting to assert herself in the family Grete’s story is like Gregor’s but with an opposite trajectory, while Gregor started as an asset and became a burden, Grete started as a burden and becomes an asset. Grete’s transformation over the story reinforces the idea that a person’s value and worthiness to exist has been tied to their ability to create wealth. As Grete gets a job, she beings to be perceived as more adult by her parents, a transformation into womanhood that is completed with her parents realizing she could be married off for a significant value. To her parents Grete’s womanhood is directly tied to her value as a person reinforcing the theme of exploitation in the story.</p>

      <h3 class="spacer"><span class="secondary ">Mr. Samsa</span></h3>
      <p class="spacer buffer-mini">Mr. Samsa is a failed businessman that at the start of the story spends his days lazing about his house doing nothing. After Gregor’s transformation he is forced to get a job as a bank attendant to try and help provide for his family. This Job leaves him exhausted but, unlike Grete or Gregor, Mr. Samsa draws a sense of pride from his work. Being a working man gives Mr. Samsa’s life a direction and purpose it had been previously lacking and shows that despite how awful and exploitative work is commonly shown to be in <i>The Metamorphosis</i> That working can still be good for a person in the right context. </p>

      <h3 class="spacer"><span class="secondary ">The Charwoman</span></h3>
      <p class="spacer ">The Charwoman is a rugged working woman and professional cleaner brought on by the Samsa’s to replace their previous servant girl who left due to Gregor’s new buggy appearance.  The Charwoman is notably the only character in the story who is unphased by Gregor’s appearance. The Charwoman should in theory be the character who sympathizes most with Gregor as she too has been worn down by years working a thankless job, but that’s not the case. Instead, she harasses him Gregor using her relative power over him to tease and belittle him. The Charwoman shows how despite common struggle people will replicate the abuses they have suffered onto others because they </p>

      <ul class="spacer buffer-mini">
        <li>Mr. Samsa’s uniform: Before he went back to work Mr. Samsa spent most days laying around in the house wearing essentially a bath robe, but when he went back to work, he starts wearing a uniform. This change creates a change in his demeanor as he starts standing straighter having regained some of his lost self-respect. In this context the uniform represents Mr. Samsa’s regained confidence and pride from working again.</li>

        <li>The woman in furs: The picture of the woman wearing fur from the magazine is Gregor’s one prized possession in the whole world. So, when his mother and sister are clearing out his room the first thing Gregor leaps to defend is this picture. The picture symbolizes Gregor’s remaining connection to his humanity and him trying to protect it shows how he is trying to cling to his humanity despite his transformation.</li>

        <li>The violin: Grete passion in life is music, she plays the violinand wants to go to school for music. At the start of the story Grete’s joy in music is personal and for her self, but at the end of the story she is being made to preform for the borders living with the Samsa’s.  The music represents Grete’s dreams for the future and how they have been warped by the necessity of providing for her family. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="spacer"><span class="secondary ">Irony</span></h3>
      <p class="spacer buffer-mini">Irony: I key irony within the story is in every character’s acceptance of Gregor’s unusual transformation and the absurdity of their situation without any questioning. This creates dramatic irony as the reader is aware of how absurd this situation is, but the characters refuse to acknowledge it. This contributes to the story’s overall tone of unreality as it shakes the reader suspension of disbelief.</p>

      <p class="spacer"><i>The Metamorphosis</i> is a story about how the systems that govern peoples lives abuse their power creating cycles of abuse among the systems victims.  The Samsa family was completely financially dependent on Gregor and his job as a travelling salesman to provide for the family and pay of their debt. The problem is that being a travelling salesman makes Gregor miserable. He works long exhausting hours, it isolates him from friends and family, and all under the watchful eye of heartless managers. Gregor is a victim of the system being used up and spit out once he was no longer useful. </p>
      <p class="spacer">It wasn’t just a system that Gregor was a victim to though. After Gregor’s transformation his family is put into a financial bind, which only gets worse as the story goes on. Now each family member has some kind of job, but they are struggling to support themselves and Gregor has become an unmanageable burden on his family.  This leads his family to start resenting Gregor and by the end of the story even Grete wishes for Gregor to leave. This ends with Gregor dying and releasing the family of his burden.</p>
      <p class="spacer">Inhumanity is expected from the massive dispassionate and faceless systems that run people’s lives, but what is shown by Gregor’s story and others in <i>The Metamorphosis</i> is that often people replicate the behaviors of the systems in the their lives. The Samsa’s, just like Gregor’s employer used him up until he was useless and then were forced to abandon him. The Samsa’s are not bad people, but they are forced to act cruelly to survive in the greater system that controls them. The systems may not be inherently malicious, but it does create cruelty which cascades downward being replicated by its victims and <i>The Metamorphosis</i> is about the consequences of that cruelty. </p>
